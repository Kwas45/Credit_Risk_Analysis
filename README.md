# Credit Risk Analysis Overview

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. The purpose of the project is to use the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company to oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.

__This project consists of three technical analysis:__
> Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk.

> Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk.

> Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk.
